            <img src="assets/myfamily.jpeg" alt="A pictuer of my family.">
            <p>In 2016 I got married to my wonderful wife (She is standing right bebind me). She is a Matieral Science Engineer who thought that i was capable to be more than a excelent sales representative and pushe me to do more. With her support I had decided to dabble in coding with unity. After making a few little games with the help of unity's resourse I wasn't feeling like my knowledge of basics in coding was lacking. When I started looking for classes or lessons to further advance my skills all of a sudden my wife got sick and was unable to work. So I did what I had to do and sought out extra employment to make as much income as possible, while trying to aid her recovery. Not to long after her health improving we were expecting a baby boy. In 2020 (in the hight of the pandemic) she gave birth to my handsom, strong son Hans. With her health not been the best I needed to be around and had to become a full time husband and father. Thank goodness that she was feeling that she could go to work and provide a better income that I could have. thien in 2022 her heath started to slip again that's when I decided to get back into expanding my my knoledge of the coding world. So that she could focus on her health and raising our son. That was when I stumbled across the UW coding bootcamp to become a fullstack web developoer.</p>
